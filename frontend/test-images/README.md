# Sample image placeholders

This directory is intended to contain the optional sample photos that power the "Sample" buttons in the Image Tools panel. The PNG files are not checked into source control so that the pull request remains free of binary assets.

To use the bundled sample buttons locally, add the following files:

- `mouse.png`
- `remote.png`
- `coaster-top.png`

Any PNG image with the matching filename will work. Reload the page after placing the files and the toggle buttons will load the corresponding sample.
