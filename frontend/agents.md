# Agent Guidlines

## General Interaction Guidlines
- Ask questions when unsure


## Coding Requirements
- **Prioritize readable code** - Ensure the code is set up so that it is as readable as possible while making sure it is efficient. Add comments for tricky sections
- **No breadcrumbs**. If you delete or move code, do not leave a comment in the old place. No "// moved to X", no "relocated". Just remove it.
