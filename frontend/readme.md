# GridFinium Frontend Guide

Welcome! This guide explains how the GridFinium frontend fits together using easy language and simple flowcharts. If you are around 14 years old and curious about how the project works, you are in the right place.

## How the codebase is organized
The project lives in a small folder with a handful of important files. Follow the flowchart to see how everything connects.

```mermaid

    A[Project Folder] --> B[index.html\n(Shapes the web page)]
    A --> C[scripts.js\n(Adds interactive logic)]
    A --> D[readme.md\n(Explains everything)]
    A --> E[docs.md\n(Documentation plan)]
```

### What each part does
- **index.html** sets up the basic layout of the page, similar to building the frame of a house.
- **scripts.js** adds the behaviors, like placing the furniture and making buttons respond when clicked.
- **docs.md** stores instructions about how to document the project.
- **readme.md** (this file) shows you how the pieces fit together.

## How the main files work together
The next flowchart zooms in on the logic inside the HTML and JavaScript files and shows the usual path of information.

```mermaid

    H[index.html
    Loads page structure] -->|Loads| S[scripts.js
    Listens for user actions]
    S -->|Reads| G[HTML elements
    (like buttons and grid cells)]
    S -->|Updates| V[Visual changes
    shown in the browser]
```

### Step-by-step explanation
1. **The browser reads `index.html`** and draws the page.
2. **`scripts.js` runs right after** and looks for buttons, inputs, or grid cells to control.
3. **When you interact with the page**, the script reacts by changing numbers, colors, or text.
4. **The browser updates the view**, so you instantly see the result of what just happened.

## Need to change something?
- Update `index.html` if you want to change the layout or add new sections to the page.
- Edit `scripts.js` if you want to change how the page behaves when someone clicks or types.
- Keep this `readme.md` updated so future developers (and curious students) can follow along easily.

Happy exploring and building!
